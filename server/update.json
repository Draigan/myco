          "textdata": "<Text>BRF cakes, also known as Brown Rice Flour cakes, are a common substrate used in the cultivation of magic mushrooms using the PF Tek (Psilocybe Fanaticus Technique). BRF cakes serve as the growth medium for mycelium, which eventually develops into fruiting mushrooms. The BRF cakes are made by mixing brown rice flour, vermiculite, and water to create a nutrient-rich substrate. This mixture provides the necessary nutrients and moisture for the mycelium to grow and colonize. </Text>"

Slowly add water while stirring the mixture until it reaches a consistency similar to damp sand. The mixture should hold together when squeezed but not be overly wet.{'\n'}3. Fill sterilized glass jars with the BRF mixture, leaving some headspace at the top for the substrate to expand during sterilization. {'\n'}4.Cover the jars with lids or aluminum foil and sterilize them using a pressure cooker or large pot with a tight-fitting lid. Sterilize the jars at 15 PSI for 60-90 minutes. This process kills any competing organisms or contaminants present in the substrate. {'\n'}5. Allow the sterilized jars to cool down to room temperature in a clean environment.{'\n'}6. Once the jars have cooled, they are ready for inoculation. Inject the spore solution using a sterile syringe through a small hole in the jar's lid or foil. Inject the spores into the substrate, distributing them evenly.<Text>"
